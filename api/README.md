# BlockTrace API

This is a simple API built with **Express.js** and **Hyperledger Fabric Gateway SDK** to retrieve Digital Product Passports (DPPs) from a blockchain network and allow interacts with web applications.

## üì¶ Requirements

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- Hyperledger Fabric running network (with chaincode `dpps-management-chaincode` installed and committed)
- A valid identity (`User1` or `Admin`) enrolled and available locally
- `.env` file with proper configuration

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Assuming you've downloaded the entire project and are currently in the `blocktrace` folder, run the following commands from the project root directory.

```bash
cd api
npm install
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the following variables (There is a .env.example that you can update):

```env
CHANNEL_NAME=main
CHAINCODE_NAME=dpps_management_chaincode
MSP_ID=Org1MSP
KEY_DIRECTORY_PATH=../../blockchain/organizations/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/users/User1@org1.example.com/msp/keystore
CERT_DIRECTORY_PATH=../../blockchain/organizations/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/users/User1@org1.example.com/msp/signcerts
TLS_CERT_PATH=../../blockchain/organizations/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/peers/peer0.org1.example.com/tls/ca.crt
PEER_ENDPOINT=localhost:7051
PEER_HOST_ALIAS=peer0.org1.example.com
```

> Make sure paths are correct relative to your API directory.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the API

```bash
npm start
```

API will be available at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## üì° Available Routes

### `GET /api/dpps`

Returns all DPPs registered on the blockchain.

**Example:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/dpps
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "dpp_id": "uuid-1234",
      "serial_number": "SN-456789",
      "owner_did": "did:example:abcd1234",
      "status": "in_use",
      "components": ["dpp_id_sub1", "dpp_id_sub2"],
